# Firebase Authentication Error Handling Improvement

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase Authentication's `signInWithEmailAndPassword()` function: insufficient error handling. The original code throws a generic error without providing specific details to help developers understand and fix the problem.

This improved version adds more robust error handling, providing user-friendly messages for common authentication issues like incorrect credentials and non-existent users.

## How to reproduce the bug:

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Replace placeholders in `firebaseConfig` with your actual Firebase project details.
3.  Run `bug.js`. You will see generic error messages. 
4. Run `bugSolution.js` to see improved error handling.

## Solution:

The solution enhances error handling by using specific error codes provided by Firebase to display more informative messages. This makes debugging easier and provides a better user experience.
